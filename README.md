## About The Project

This project is for educational porpuses only.
In this project I try to make something similar to watson-vcard.netlify.app website using React.js.
This project took a lot of my time because I work on it at my free time.
But it was worth doing, I learned a lot of new things, new tools, and how use them with each other that.
I had a lot of hard challenges that I manage to overcome. =)
